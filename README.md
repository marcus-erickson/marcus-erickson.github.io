# Marcus Erickson - Developer Tools & Resources

This is the source for my personal site at [marcus-erickson.github.io](https://marcus-erickson.github.io).

## About

I'm Marcus Erickson, long-time deeloper and AI coding afficionado. I build tools and write guides to help developers ship better React Native applications.AI tools like Claude and Cursor have made it incredibly fast to build working prototypes. But there's a significant gap between "it works on my machine" and "it's ready for real users." I want to help you bridge that gap!

That last 20% is where apps succeed or fail:
- Console logs left in production code
- Missing error boundaries that crash the whole app
- Accessibility overlooked
- App Store rejections for missing requirements
- Performance issues with real data
- Security vulnerabilities you didn't know to check

**React Project Checkup Toolkit bridges that gap.** These are the checklists and prompts I wish I'd had—tools to transform your AI-assisted prototype into a professional app you're confident shipping.
